# nuimo-web-game
Simple, quick demo to show nuimo working over websockets to control a game.
The game is dumb at the moment. Simply drive your ship (using nuimo), colliding with the circles to gain points.
No time limits or anything.

##Controls
- Rotate: rotates the ship either left or right
- Button down: apply acceleration
- Button up: remove acceleration
